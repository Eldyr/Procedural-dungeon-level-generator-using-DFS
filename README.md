# Procedural-dungeon-level-generator-using-DFS

A procedural dungeon generationator built in Unity using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to dynamically create maze-like dungeon levels.
This project demonstrates how to generate randomized, fully traversable dungeon layouts at runtime â€” perfect for roguelike or exploration-based games.
